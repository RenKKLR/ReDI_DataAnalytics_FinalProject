# Loan Approval Prediction
The final project of the course data analytics at ReDI School

Why this project:
* to chose a realistic topic, not research-based;
* to select a big dataset, more than 4000 rows
* to make a prediction by training machine learning models

What does this project do:
* Data Exploration and Cleaning
* Features selection after checking the correlation
* Machine Learning Models training and testing
* Comparision of the test scores from different ML models
* K-Fold cross validation

What function could be upgraded in the future:
* Transform the column cibil rating into categories to see the differences
* Try other evaluation metrics for cross validation
* Change perspective from "Prediction" to "Decision making"
