# Loan Approval Prediction
The final project of the course data analytics at ReDI School

Why this project:
* to chose a realistic topic, not research-based;
* to select a big dataset, more than 4000 rows
* to make a prediction by training machine learning models

What does this project do:
* Data Exploration and Cleaning
* Features selection after checking the correlation
* Machine Learning Models training and testing
* Comparision of the test scores from different ML models
* K-Fold cross validation

What function could be upgraded in the future:
* Transform the column cibil rating into categories to see the differences
* Try other evaluation metrics for cross validation
* More visualization

About Dataset:
The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution. 
It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status. 
This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models and algorithms that predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the given features.
